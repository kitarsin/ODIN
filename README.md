# ODIN
ODIN is a Gamified Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) developed by InsomniCode. It is designed to assist CS/IT students in mastering C# Bitwise and Logical Operators.

Traditional IDEs only catch syntax errors. ODIN goes further by analyzing Keystroke Dynamics and Compilation Behavior to detect the student's cognitive state. It identifies when a student is "Wheel-Spinning" (stuck in a loop of failure) or "Gaming the System" (guessing/spamming hints) and provides scaffolded interventions to foster resilience.
